<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>Why do my photo posts have weird borders?</h3>
    <p>This is a result of Tumblr's new post format (NPF) which is used when you post from mobile or the new post editor on web. With the old post format it was possible for themes to determine the post type (text, photo, etc), but with the new format everything is seen as a text post. This means that any custom styles meant for photo posts will no longer be used.</p>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>How do I change posts per page?</h3>
    <p>Go to your edit theme page. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings panel and click <b>Advanced options</b>. The setting will be listed here.</p>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>When I go to my blog on my phone, my theme doesn’t show up?</h3>
    <p>Go to your edit theme page. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings panel and click <b>Advanced options</b>. Make sure that <b>Use default mobile theme</b> and <b>Enable Google AMP</b> are both unchecked. Note that the Tumblr app doesn’t show custom themes, you have to look at it from Chrome/Safari</p>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>Can I move or delete the theme credit?</h3>
    <p>Do whatever you want. Just don’t claim the theme as your own work.</p>
</div>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>A theme I like was removed?</h3>
    <p>Check our <a href="/legacy">legacy themes page. Keep in mind that these themes were made before the NPF era so they don't really look as intended anymore</a></p>
