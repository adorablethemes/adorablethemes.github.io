<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>Why do my photos on the copycat theme have weird borders?</h3>
    <p>Tumblr introduced a new post format a few years ago, and posts made from the mobile app use this format. Themes have no way of determining what the post type is for these, so they get rendered as text posts. If you want your posts to display correctly, you have to post them from desktop. Any posts you have already made will need to be deleted and reposted.</p>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>When I go to my blog on my phone, my theme doesn’t show up?</h3>
    <p>Go to your edit theme page. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings panel and click <b>Advanced options</b>. Make sure that <b>Use default mobile theme</b> and <b>Enable Google AMP</b> are both unchecked. Note that the Tumblr app doesn’t show custom themes, you have to look at it from Chrome/Safari</p>
