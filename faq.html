        <li>Remove any custom elements like music players or cursors.</li>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>Why are all of my new photo/video/etc posts showing up as text posts?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/177490335925/express-yourself-the-way-you-want-using-as-much">Tumblr made a change in the mobile app</a> that causes posts made from the app to always be treated as text posts. If you want your posts to display normally, you have to post them from desktop. Any posts you have already made will need to be deleted and reposted.</p>
