<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>Why do my photo posts have weird borders?</h3>
    <p>Tumblr started phasing out post types years ago. Anything posted from the mobile app or the new beta post editor will be treated as a text post by themes. The only way around this is to make your posts using the old post editor on desktop.</p>

<div class="post-section question">
    <h3>When I go to my blog on my phone, my theme doesn’t show up?</h3>
    <p>Go to your edit theme page. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings panel and click <b>Advanced options</b>. Make sure that <b>Use default mobile theme</b> and <b>Enable Google AMP</b> are both unchecked. Note that the Tumblr app doesn’t show custom themes, you have to look at it from Chrome/Safari</p>
